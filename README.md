# Face Recognisation
 Face Recognisation By Open CV Without Real Time Detection 
# Overview

This project implements a face recognition system using OpenCV, FaceNet, and Python. The system captures face images, extracts features, encodes them, and recognizes faces based on the trained model. A Streamlit UI is also provided for ease of use.

# Features

Face detection and alignment using OpenCV.

Feature extraction and encoding using FaceNet.

Face recognition with high accuracy.

Ability to create and use a custom dataset.

Streamlit UI for an interactive user experience.

# Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

FaceNet (for feature extraction and encoding)

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Streamlit (for UI)
